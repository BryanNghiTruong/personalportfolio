            <p>I hold a genuine passion for computers and technology, and I'm actively working towards becoming a skilled software 
              and web developer. My fascination with electronics began in my early childhood, and I've spent a significant amount of 
              time exploring various forms of media and technology crafted by innovative minds.

                After completing my diploma, I underwent a significant change in perspective - I transitioned from being a consumer to 
                becoming a creator. This shift has ignited a strong desire in me not only to excel in coding but also to use it as a means 
                to express my creativity alongside my personal interests."
